Hello there! I'm a PhD student in biostatistics at Harvard, advised by [Brent Coull](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/brent-coull/){:target="\_blank"} and [Finale Doshi-Velez](https://finale.seas.harvard.edu){:target="\_blank"}. I'm part of the [Data to Actionable Knowledge Lab (DtAK)](https://dtak.github.io){:target="\_blank"}. Previously I did a master's in statistics at Duke, where I worked with [Cynthia Rudin](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~cynthia/){:target="\_blank"}.

I'm interested in probabilistic machine learning, particularly Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) and Gaussian processes (GPs). I think about questions like:
- How do we design priors that encode functional properties (e.g., smoothness or sparsity)?
- What are the theoretical connections between variational BNNs and GPs? 
- And, maybe one day, how can we guide learning towards a causal understanding to help with generalization?
