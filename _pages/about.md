Hello there! I'm a PhD student in biostatistics at Harvard, advised by [Finale Doshi-Velez](https://finale.seas.harvard.edu){:target="\_blank"} and [Brent Coull](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/brent-coull/){:target="\_blank"}. I'm part of the [Data to Actionable Knowledge Lab (DtAK)](https://dtak.github.io){:target="\_blank"}. Previously I worked with [Cynthia Rudin](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~cynthia/){:target="\_blank"} while completing a master's in statistics at Duke. 

I'm interested in probabilistic machine learning, particularly Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) and Gaussian processes (GPs). I think about questions like:
- How do we design priors that encode meaningful functional properties?
- What are the theoretical connections between BNNs and GPs, especially under approximate inference? 
- And (maybe one day), how can we guide learning towards a causal understanding to help with generalization? 

Here's a <a href="https://virtual.aistats.org/virtual/2022/poster/3368">recent talk</a> I gave at AISTATS about mean-field variational BNNs.
